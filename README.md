This is a [Google](https://www.google.com) clone that I created using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The clone uses Google Custom Search API to fetch search results from Google. The clone is hosted on Vercel.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
